        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (256 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (115 g) powdered sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter, room temp and cut into pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F and line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place the flour, powdered sugar, salt, and butter into the bowl of a food processor. Process for 30 seconds to 60 seconds. Stop when the mixture forms one mass the bowl. If it's not doing that, keep going in 10-second increments until it does. The dough is ready when the it clumps together when pressed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dump the dough onto the counter and gently press it together. Lightly knead the dough a few times and form it into a square shape. If it's still crumbly, keep kneading it with your hands until it makes a cohesive dough, or pop it back in the food processor for a few more pulses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the dough is quite soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 10 to 20 minutes, until it's cool but still pliable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface to a 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness (depending on how thick you like your cookies) and either use a knife to cut out rectangles or use a cutter to make shapes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer the cookies to one of the parchment-lined baking sheets. Chill the cookies on the sheet pan in the freezer for 15 minutes or until the cookies are solid to the touch.</p>
                <p>Transfer the frozen cookies, in batches, onto the other baking sheets, leaving about 1/2 inch between each cookie.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake the cookies, one pan at a time, for 18 to 23 minutes, or until the cookies are dry to the touch and the bottoms just begin to turn golden.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove from the oven and cool on a rack before transferring to a container for storage. The baked and cooled cookies can be stored in an airtight container for several days.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
