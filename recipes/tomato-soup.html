        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Classic Tomato Soup is rich with a velvety texture. It’s easy to make with canned tomatoes, and perfectly suited for all of your grilled cheese dipping needs.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 large onion, yellow or white, diced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly cracked pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>4 cups (32 ounces) low sodium chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven set over medium heat, add the butter. Once it starts to foam, add the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until both have softened and are fragrant, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add flour. Stir to make a paste. Continue stirring until the flour has taken on a light brown color. Stir and scrape with wooden spoon, 5-7 minutes. The onion paste should look golden with a little brown caramelization.</li>
            <li>Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken stock, and sugar. Stir to combine. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce heat to medium and let simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Purée the soup with an immersion blender. Alternatively, fill a countertop blender less than halfway with the hot soup. Remove the center lid insert. This allows the hot steam to escape. Cover the hole with a folded kitchen towel and place your hand over the top. Blend. Repeat as necessary until all of the soup has been puréed.<p>Ladle into bowls, topped with freshly cracked pepper, slivered basil, and of course, grilled cheese sandwiches.</p></li>
